Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End, says this: 

“Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, is that varying degrees or states of tension 
seem to be involved in all our experiences, and that the most gratifying ones are those in which 
whatever tensions are created are also released. Or, to use another familiar set of terms, 
an experience is gratifying to the extent that those expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled.”
<br><br>
But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems begin. 
How can the origin be traced when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace?

  <div class="trace-one">It is exactly like tracing the moment of the big bang</div>
  <div class="trace-two">—we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning, before the universe burst into being,</div>
  <div class="trace-three">but we can't go back to the precise beginning because that would precede knowledge,</div> 
  <div class="trace-four">and we can't “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born.</div>
