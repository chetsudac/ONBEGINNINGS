  <marquee behavior="alternate">In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings <br> 
    that we cannot even conceive of it. Not every poem is finished—<br>
    one poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, <br> 
    which may be an ending, but it is the ending of a poem without an end.</marquee>

  <marquee behavior="alternate">Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that <br> no poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely abandoned. <br>This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, <br>for where quotations begin is in a cloud.</marquee>

  <marquee behavior="alternate">Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, <br>
     and to my mind so accurately, that i have never forgotten it: the opening line of a poem,<br>
      he said, is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, <br>
      and the poet's task is to create the tree from which such a fruit would fall.</marquee>
