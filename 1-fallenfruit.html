      <span class="hover">⬤</span>  In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings <span class="hover">⬤</span>  
      that we cannot even conceive of it. <span class="hover">⬤</span>  Not every poem is finished—one poem is <span class="hover">⬤</span> abandoned, 
      another <span class="hover">⬤</span> catches fire and is <span class="hover">⬤</span> carried away by the wind, <span class="hover">⬤</span> which may be an ending, 
      but it is the ending of <span class="hover">⬤</span> a poem without an end.

      <span class="hover">⬤</span> Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, 
      once said that <span class="hover">⬤</span> no poem is ever ended, that every <span class="hover">⬤</span> poem is merely <span class="hover">⬤</span> abandoned. 
      <span class="hover">⬤</span>  This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations <span class="hover">⬤</span>  begin is in a cloud.

          <span class="hover">⬤</span> Paul Valéry also described his perception of <span class="hover">⬤</span> first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, 
          <span class="hover">⬤</span> that i have never forgotten it: <span class="hover">⬤</span> the opening line of <span class="hover">⬤</span> a poem, 
          he said, is like finding <span class="hover">⬤</span> a fruit on the ground, a piece of <span class="hover">⬤</span> fallen fruit you have never seen before, 
          and the poet's task is to <span class="hover">⬤</span> create the tree from which such <span class="hover">⬤</span> a fruit would fall.
